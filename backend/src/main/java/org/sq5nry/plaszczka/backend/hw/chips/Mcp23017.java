/**
 * 16-Bit I2C I/O Expander with Serial Interface
 *
 * The MCP23017/MCP23S17 (MCP23X17) device family provides 16-bit, general purpose parallel I/O expansion for I2C hw
 * applications. The MCP23X17 consists of multiple 8-bit configuration registers for input, output and polarity selection.
 * The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing the I/O configuration bits (IODIRA/B).
 * The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of the
 * Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. All registers can be read by the system master.
 *
 * The 16-bit I/O port functionally consists of two 8-bit ports (PORTA and PORTB). The MCP23X17 can be configured
 * to operate in the 8-bit or 16-bit modes via IOCON.BANK. There are two interrupt pins, INTA and INTB, that can be
 * associated with their respective ports, or can be logically ORâ€™ed together so that both pins will activate if either port
 * causes an interrupt. The interrupt output can be configured to activate under two conditions (mutually exclusive):
 * 1. When any input state differs from its corresponding Input Port register state. This is used to indicate to the
 *    system master that an input state has changed.
 * 2. When an input state differs from a preconfigured register value (DEFVAL register).
 *
 * The Interrupt Capture register captures port values at the time of the interrupt, thereby saving the condition that
 * caused the interrupt. The Power-on Reset (POR) sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device
 * state machine. The hardware address pins are used to determine the device address.
